# Summary
We introduce `metasynth`, a Python package designed to transparently generate privacy-preserving synthetic data. This tool aids data owners in sharing their data's structure and approximated content without compromising privacy. `Metasynth` focuses on the 'augmented plausible' category of synthetic data, balancing transparency with privacy through its plug-in system. While the analytical validity of the generated data is intentionally limited, its potential uses include exploratory analyses, script development, and external communication. The software is flexible, scalable, and easily extended to meet diverse privacy needs.

# Statement of need

`Metasynth` is a python package for generating synthetic data with a focus on privacy and disclosure control. It is aimed at owners of sensitive datasets such as public organisations, research groups, and individual researchers who want to improve the accessibility of their data for research and reproducibility by others. The goal of `metasynth` is to make it easy for data owners to share the structure and and approximation of the content of their data with others without any privacy concerns.

With this goal in mind, `metasynth` distinguishes itself from existing software for generating synthetic data [e.g., @nowok2016synthpop; @templ2017simulation; @ping2017datasynthesizer] by restricting itself to the "augmented plausible" category of synthetic data [@bates2019ons]. This choice enables the software to generate synthetic data with __privacy and disclosure guarantees__ through a plug-in system. Moreover, our system provides an __auditable and editable intermediate representation__ in the form of a human- and machine-readable `.json` metadata file from which new data can be synthesized.

Through our focus on privacy and transparency, `metasynth` explicitly avoids generating synthetic data with high analytical validity. The data generated by our system is realistic in terms of data structure and plausible in terms of values for each variable, but any multivariate relations or conditional patterns are excluded. This has implications for how this synthetic data can be used: not for statistical analysis and inference, but rather for initial exploration, analysis script development, and communication outside the data owner's institution. In the intended use case, an external researcher can make use of the synthetic data to assess the feasibility of their intended research before making the (often time-consuming) step of requesting access to the sensitive source data for the final analysis.

As mentioned before,the privacy capacities of `metasynth` are extensible through a plug-in system, recognizing that different data owners have different needs and definitions of privacy. A data owner can define under which conditions they would accept open distribution of their synthetic data --- be it based on differential privacy [@dwork2006differential], statistical disclosure control [@dewolf2012statistical], k-anonymity [@sweeney2002k], or another specific definition of privacy. As part of the initial release of `metasynth`, we publish two proof-of-concept plugins: one following the disclosure control guidelines from Eurostat [@bond2015guidelines], and one based on the sample-and-aggregate technique for differential privacy [@dwork2010differential, pp. 142].

# Software features

At its core, `Metasynth` is designed for three functions, which are briefly described in this section:

1. __Estimation__: Automatically select univariate distributions and fit them to a well-defined tabular dataset, possibly with privacy guarantees.
2. __(De)serialization__: Create an intermediate representation of the fitted model for auditing, editing, and exporting.
3. __Generation__: Generate new synthetic datasets based on the fitted model or its serialized representation.

## Estimation
The generative model for multivariate datasets in `metasynth` makes the simplifying assumption of marginal independence: each column is considered separately, just as is done in e.g., naïve Bayes classifiers[@hastie2009elements]. Formally, this leads to the following generative model for the $K$-variate data $\mathbf{x}$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:model}
p(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k)
\end{equation}

There are many advantages to this naïve approach when compared to more advanced generative models: it is transparent and explainable, it is able to flexibly handle data of mixed types, and it is computationally scalable to high-dimensional datasets. As mentioned before, the tradeoff is the limited analytical validity when the independence assumption does not hold: in the synthetic data, the expected value of correlations, regression parameters, and other measures of association is 0.

For each data type supported by `metasynth`, there is a set of candidate distributions that can be fitted to that data type (see Table \autoref{tbl:dist}). To estimate the generative model of Equation \autoref{eq:model}, for each variable the software fits all compatible candidate distributions --- by default with maximum likelihood estimation --- and then selects the one with the lowest AIC [@akaike1973information].

# A basic example

First, we create an example dataset using `polars` [@vink2023polars], the data frame library used internally in `metasynth`.

```py
import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "ID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        "fruits": ["banana", "banana", "apple", "apple", "banana"],
        "B": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
        "cars": ["beetle", "audi", "beetle", "beetle", "beetle"],
        "optional": [28, 300, None, 2, -30],
    }
)

# convert appropriate columns to categorical data type
df = df.with_columns([
    pl.col("fruits").cast(pl.Categorical),
    pl.col("cars").cast(pl.Categorical),
])
```

Then, a model can be fitted and the intermediate representation can be stored as follows:
```py
from metasynth import MetaDataset

# Ensure that the column "ID" has unique values
# when data is synthesized later
mds_spec = {
    "ID": {"unique": True}
}

# create metadataset
mds = MetaDataset.from_dataframe(df, spec=mds_spec)

# write to json
mds.to_json("metasynth_example.json")
```

After this, the json can be inspected or audited, potentially edited, and subsequently exported from the secure environment. Then, outside the secure environment, the following code can be run to synthesize new data:

```py
# load json into a metadataset object
mds_out = MetaDataset.from_json("metasynth_example.json")

# create a fake dataset
mds_out.synthesize(10)
```
