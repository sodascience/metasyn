What is metasyn?
================

Metasyn is a python package for generating synthetic data with a focus on maintaining privacy.
It is aimed at owners of sensitive datasets such as public organisations, research groups, and individual researchers who
want to improve the accessibility, reproducibility and reusability of their data. The goal of metasyn is to make it easy
for data owners to share the structure and approximation of the content of their data with others with fewer privacy concerns.

Use cases
---------

Below are a few possible use cases for metasyn:

- A researcher who cannot share their dataset because of privacy concerns, but shares a synthetic version for reproducibility.
- A data provider wants to show a preview of their sensitive data using synthetic versions of their datasets.
- A developer can create synthetic data before they have real data so they can write and test data analysis scripts.

Metasyn is specifically **not** designed for creating highly accurate synthetic data, where all relationships between columns are reproduced.

Key features
------------
- **Easy**: Creating your first synthetic dataset shouldn't take more than 15 minutes with our :doc:`quickstart <quick_start>`.
- **Fast**: Creating synthetic data takes mere seconds for medium sized (~1000 rows) datasets.
- **Safe and Understandable Synthetic Data**: As little information as possible is retained from the original dataset, and you can inspect and understand exactly which information is used to create your synthetic data.
- **Flexible**: You can :doc:`adjust <improve_synth>` the synthetic data columns to your liking, create your own distributions, extension and more.
- **Data Type Support**: Metasyn supports generating synthetic data for a variety of common data types including ``categorical``, ``string``, ``integer``, ``float``, ``date``, ``time``, and ``datetime``.
- **Integration with Faker**: Metasyn integrates with the `faker <https://github.com/joke2k/faker>`__ package, a Python library for generating fake data such as names and emails. Allowing for more realistic synthetic data.
- **Structured String Detection**: Metasyn identifies structured strings within your dataset, which can include formatted text, codes, identifiers, or any string that follows a specific pattern.
- **Handling Unique Values**: Metasyn can identify and process variables with unique values or keys in the data, preserving their uniqueness in the synthetic dataset.

.. _metaframes and GMF:

MetaFrames and GMF files
------------------------

   :align: center

One of the main distinguishing features of metasyn is the ability to save the model for
your dataset in a standardized, human understandable and machine readable format: the Generative
Metadata Format (GMF). The equivalent object in Python is the :class:`metasyn.MetaFrame`.

.. admonition:: Why do I need the MetaFrame or GMF file?

  MetaFrames are a core part of the design philosphy of metasyn: you should inspect the model before 
  releasing any potentially private information. While metasyn will generally provide safe synthetic 
  output, this cannot be guaranteed; whether something is considered privacy sensitive depends on the
  context, which metasyn does not have access to. We also generally recommend saving the GMF file
  for reproducibility purposes.

The GMF format is available in two file formats: .json and .toml.

Metasyn supports both the .toml and .json variant equally. The advantage of the .json file is that it has better
compatibility with programming languages. On the other hand, .toml files are generally easier to read and edit 
manually.
