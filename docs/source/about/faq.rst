Here, we've compiled answers to commonly asked questions about MetaSynth and its development. If you can't find the information you're looking for, feel free to :doc:`contact us </about/contact>`.



**Can I use pandas DataFrames with MetaSynth?**
------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can use pandas DataFrames with MetaSynth. However, please note that MetaSynth internally utilizes polars for consistent typing and handling of non-existing data. Although supplying pandas DataFrames is supported, there may be conversion issues, particularly in certain edge cases. To ensure optimal functionality, we recommend creating polars DataFrames. The synthetic datasets generated by MetaSynth are always in the form of polars DataFrames. If needed, you can easily convert them back to pandas DataFrames using the `df_pandas = df_polars.to_pandas()` method.


**What is the classification of MetaSynth's synthetic datasets?**
------------------------------------------------------------
MetaSynth's synthetically generated datasets are classified as `Synthetically-Augmented Plausible datasets <https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsmethodologyworkingpaperseriesnumber16syntheticdatapilot>`__, as categorized by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

.. epigraph:: ONS criteria for a Synthetically-augmented plausible dataset:
   
   * Preserve the format and record-level plausibility as detailed previously and replicate marginal (univariate) distributions where possible.
   * Constructed based on the real dataset, values are generated based on observed distributions (with added fuzziness and smoothing) but no attempt made to preserve relationships.
   * Missing value codes and their frequency is to be preserved.
   * Disclosure control evaluation is necessary case by case, special care to be taken with names and so on.
   * To be used for extended code testing, minimal analytical value, non-negligible disclosure risk.
