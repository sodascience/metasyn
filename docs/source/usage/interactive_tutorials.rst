Interactive Tutorials
====================

If you're new to Python or simply want to quickly explore the basic features of MetaSynth, you can try one of the following interactive tutorials. They provide a step-by-step walkthrough and example dataset to help you get started. At the moment, there are two interactive tutorials available. A basic and an adanced one. Both will take you through the process of :doc:`/usage/generating_metadata` and :doc:`/usage/generating_synthetic_data`, though the advanced one goes in more depth.

Basic:
   - Binder: `Open in Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sodascience/metasynth/HEAD?labpath=examples%2Fgetting_started.ipynb>`_
   - Google Colab: `Open in Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/sodascience/metasynth/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb>`_
   - GitHub: `View on GitHub <https://github.com/sodascience/metasynth/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb>`_
