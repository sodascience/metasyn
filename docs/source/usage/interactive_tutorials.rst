Interactive Tutorials
=====================

If you're new to Python or simply want to quickly explore the basic features of MetaSynth, you can try one of the following interactive tutorials. They provide a step-by-step walkthrough and example dataset to help you get started. At the moment, there are two interactive tutorials available. A basic and an advanced one. Both will take you through the process of :doc:`/usage/generating_metadata` and :doc:`/usage/generating_synthetic_data`, with the advanced one going in more depth and showing more features of MetaSynth.

Basic:
