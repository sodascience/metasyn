Interactive Tutorials
=====================

If you're new to Python or simply want to quickly explore the basic features of metasyn, you can try one of the following interactive tutorials. They provide a step-by-step walkthrough and example dataset to help you get started. At the moment, there are two interactive tutorials available. A basic and an advanced one. Both will take you through the process of :doc:`/usage/generating_metaframes`, :doc:`/usage/exporting_metaframes`,  and :doc:`/usage/generating_synthetic_data`. The advanced tutorial provides a more in-depth look at customizing the handling of columns to generate cleaner synthetic data tailored to your use case.
