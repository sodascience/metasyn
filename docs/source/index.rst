Metasyn Documentation
=======================

``Metasyn`` is a Python package for generating synthetic tabular data with a focus on privacy.
It is designed for owners of sensitive datasets who want to share approximations of their data so that
others can perform exploratory analysis and testing without disclosing real values.
