MetaSynth Documentation
=======================
Welcome to the `MetaSynth <https://github.com/sodascience/metasynth/>`_ documentation. MetaSynth is a Python package that facilitates the generation of synthetic data and metadata, enabling users to create surrogate datasets that mimic the structure and characteristics of their original data while preserving privacy.

.. warning:: 
   MetaSynth, and this documentation, are under active development. As a result, this documentation is still heavily work in progress. If you see any errors, missing content or have a suggestion for new content, feel free to :doc:`let us know </about/contact>`!

The :doc:`/usage/usage` contains detailed, step-by-step instructions, as well as best practices for using the package. If you're new to MetaSynth, we recommend you start here!

:doc:`/api/metasynth`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :doc:`/api/metasynth` is a technical reference for MetaSynth. Here, each function, class, and module is outlined in detail, giving you a comprehensive understanding of how the package works and how to use its various functionalities.  If, for example, you'd like to discover which parameters can be used for which function, you can find that here.

:doc:`/developer/developer`
