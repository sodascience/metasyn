Welcome to the `metasyn <https://github.com/sodascience/metasyn/>`_ documentation. 

``Metasyn`` is a Python package for generating synthetic tabular data with a focus on privacy. It is designed for owners of sensitive datasets who want to share approximations of their data so that others can perform exploratory analysis and testing without disclosing real values.
