``Metasyn`` is a python package for generating synthetic data with a focus on maintaining privacy.
It is aimed at owners of sensitive datasets such as public organisations, research groups, and individual researchers who
want to improve the accessibility, reproducibility and reusability of their data. The goal of metasyn is to make it easy
for data owners to share the structure and approximation of the content of their data with others with fewer privacy concerns.
