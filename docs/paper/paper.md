# Summary
Synthetic data is a promising tool for improving the accessibility of datasets that are otherwise too sensitive to be shared publicly. To this end, we introduce `metasynth`, a Python package for generating synthetic data from tabular datasets. Unlike existing synthetic data generation software, `metasynth` is built on a simple generative model with a "naive" marginal independence assumption --- an explicit choice that lowers the multivariate precision of the synthetic data in order to maintain transparency and auditability, to keep information leakage to a minimum, and even to enable privacy or disclosure risk guarantees through a plug-in system. While the analytical validity of the generated data is thus intentionally limited, its potential uses are broad, including exploratory analyses, code development and testing, and external communication and teaching. `Metasynth` is flexible, scalable, and easily extended to meet diverse privacy needs.

# Statement of need

`Metasynth` is a python package for generating synthetic data with a focus on privacy and disclosure control. It is aimed at owners of sensitive datasets such as public organisations, research groups, and individual researchers who want to improve the accessibility of their data for research and reproducibility by others. The goal of `metasynth` is to make it easy for data owners to share the structure and and approximation of the content of their data with others without any privacy concerns.

With this goal in mind, `metasynth` distinguishes itself from existing software for generating synthetic data [e.g., @nowok2016synthpop; @templ2017simulation; @ping2017datasynthesizer] by restricting itself to the "augmented plausible" category of synthetic data [@bates2019ons]. This choice enables the software to generate synthetic data with __privacy and disclosure guarantees__ through a plug-in system. Moreover, our system provides an __auditable and editable intermediate representation__ in the form of a human- and machine-readable `.json` metadata file from which new data can be synthesized.

Through our focus on privacy and transparency, `metasynth` explicitly avoids generating synthetic data with high analytical validity. The data generated by our system is realistic in terms of data structure and plausible in terms of values for each variable, but any multivariate relations or conditional patterns are excluded. This has implications for how this synthetic data can be used: not for statistical analysis and inference, but rather for initial exploration, analysis script development, and communication outside the data owner's institution. In the intended use case, an external researcher can make use of the synthetic data to assess the feasibility of their intended research before making the (often time-consuming) step of requesting access to the sensitive source data for the final analysis.

As mentioned before,the privacy capacities of `metasynth` are extensible through a plug-in system, recognizing that different data owners have different needs and definitions of privacy. A data owner can define under which conditions they would accept open distribution of their synthetic data --- be it based on differential privacy [@dwork2006differential], statistical disclosure control [@dewolf2012statistical], k-anonymity [@sweeney2002k], or another specific definition of privacy. As part of the initial release of `metasynth`, we publish two proof-of-concept plugins: one following the disclosure control guidelines from Eurostat [@bond2015guidelines], and one based on the sample-and-aggregate technique for differential privacy [@dwork2010differential, pp. 142].

# Software features

At its core, `Metasynth` is designed for three functions, which are briefly described in this section:

1. __Estimation__: Automatically select univariate distributions and fit them to a well-defined tabular dataset, possibly with privacy guarantees.
2. __(De)serialization__: Create an intermediate representation of the fitted model for auditing, editing, and exporting.
3. __Generation__: Generate new synthetic datasets based on the fitted model or its serialized representation.

## Estimation
The generative model for multivariate datasets in `metasynth` makes the simplifying assumption of marginal independence: each column is considered separately, just as is done in e.g., naïve Bayes classifiers[@hastie2009elements]. Formally, this leads to the following generative model for the $K$-variate data $\mathbf{x}$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:model}
p(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k)
\end{equation}

There are many advantages to this naïve approach when compared to more advanced generative models: it is transparent and explainable, it is able to flexibly handle data of mixed types, and it is computationally scalable to high-dimensional datasets. As mentioned before, the tradeoff is the limited analytical validity when the independence assumption does not hold: in the synthetic data, the expected value of correlations, regression parameters, and other measures of association is 0.

Model estimation starts with an appropriately pre-processed data frame. For `metasynth`, this means the data frame is tidy [@wickham2014tidy], each column has the correct data type, and missing data are represented by a missing value. Internally, our software uses the `polars` data frame library [@vink2023polars], as it is performant, has consistent data types, and native support for missing data (`null`). A simple example source table could look like this (note that categorical data has the appropriate `cat` data type, not `str`):

```
┌─────┬────────┬─────┬────────┬──────────┐
│ ID  ┆ fruits ┆ B   ┆ cars   ┆ optional │
│ --- ┆ ---    ┆ --- ┆ ---    ┆ ---      │
│ i64 ┆ cat    ┆ i64 ┆ cat    ┆ i64      │
╞═════╪════════╪═════╪════════╪══════════╡
│ 1   ┆ banana ┆ 5   ┆ beetle ┆ 28       │
│ 2   ┆ banana ┆ 4   ┆ audi   ┆ 300      │
│ 3   ┆ apple  ┆ 3   ┆ beetle ┆ null     │
│ 4   ┆ apple  ┆ 2   ┆ beetle ┆ 2        │
│ 5   ┆ banana ┆ 1   ┆ beetle ┆ -30      │
└─────┴────────┴─────┴────────┴──────────┘
```

For each data type supported by `metasynth`, there is a set of candidate distributions that can be fitted to that data type (see Table \autoref{tbl:dist}). To estimate the generative model of Equation \autoref{eq:model}, for each variable the software fits all compatible candidate distributions --- by default with maximum likelihood estimation --- and then selects the one with the lowest AIC [@akaike1973information]. 

Table: \label{tbl:dist} Candidate distributions associated with data types in the core `metasynth` package.

| Variable type | Data type | example | candidate distributions | 
| :------------ | :-------- | :------ | :---------------------- |
| continuous | float | 1.0, 2.1, ... | UniformDistribution, NormalDistribution, ... |
| discrete | int | 1, 2, ... | DiscreteUniformDistribution |
| categorical | pl.Categorical | gender, country | MultinoulliDistribution |
| structured string | str | Room number A108, C122 | RegexDistribution |
| unstructured string | str | Names, open answers | FakerDistribution, LLMDistribution |
| temporal | Date, Datetime | 2021-01-13, 01:40:12 | DateUniformDistribution |

Generative model estimation done in code as follows:

```python
from metasynth import MetaDataset

# "ID" column is the primary key;
# ensure that it has unique values
# when data is synthesized later
spec_dict = {
  "ID": {"unique": True}
}

# create metadataset
mds = MetaDataset.from_dataframe(df, spec=spec_dict)
```

## Serialization and deserialization
After a fitted model object is created, `metasynth` allows it to be transparently stored in a human- and machine-readable `.json` file. This file can be considered as metadata: it contains dataset-level descriptive information as well as variable-level information. The metadata format has a specific structure, which we call `generative metadata format`, or `gmf`. The header contains the following dataset-level information:

```json
"n_rows": 5,
"n_columns": 5,
"provenance": {
    "created by": {
        "name": "MetaSynth",
        "version": "0.1.2+15.ged3af36",
        "privacy": null
    },
    "creation time": "2022-11-17T13:54:16.686166"
}
```

Then, for each variable the `gmf` file contains information the name, the data type, the proportion of missing values, and the distribution fitted on the data. For example, a table column containing different types of fruits could result in the following `.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "fruits",
  "type": "categorical",
  "dtype": "<class 'polars.datatypes.Categorical'>",
  "prop_missing": 0.0,
  "distribution": {
    "name": "MultinoulliDistribution",
    "parameters": {
      "labels": ["apple", "banana"],
      "probs": [0.4, 0.6]
    }
  }
}
```

There are several advantages to creating such a serialized representation. First, it can be audited: the data owner can see exactly what information from the real data is made public through exporting the synthetic data, namely, the parameters of the distribution. Second, the file can be edited. For example, if a data owner thinks some of the labels of the "fruit" column contain sensitive information, these can simply be pseudonymized in the metadata file. Third, after exporting this file, an unlimited number of synthetic records can be created without incurring additional privacy risks, because the original data is no longer part of the synthetization process.

## Data generation

After creating either the fitted model object from the original data or by deserializing a model object from a `.json` file, new data can be generated by the object. For each variable in the model object, the software randomly samples from the fitted distribution to create a synthetic version of the data. 

```python
from metasynth import MetaDataset

# load json into a metadataset object
mds = MetaDataset.from_json("metasynth_example.json")

# create a fake dataset
mds.synthesize(10)
```

This may result in the following `polars` data frame. Note that missing values in the `optional` column are appropriately reproduced as well, courtesy of the "prop_missing" entry in the metadata format.

# Plug-ins and automatic privacy
In addition to the core features described above, the `metasynth` package allows for plug-ins: add-on packages that alter the behaviour of the parameter estimation. Through this system, privacy guarantees can be built into `metasynth`. For example, a package called [`metasynth-disclosure-control`](https://github.com/sodascience/metasynth-disclosure-control) implements the disclosure control output guidelines from Eurostat [@bond2015guidelines] by re-implementing the `fit()` method of the candidate distributions shown in Table \autoref{tbl:dist} to include a micro-aggregation step. In this way, information transfer from the sensitive real data to the synthetic public data can be further reduced. 

This plug-in system is user-friendly: the user only needs to `pip install` the package and then metasynth can automatically find it to make the methods accessible:

```python
from metasynth import MetaDataset
from metasynthcontrib.disclosure import DisclosurePrivacy

mds = MetaDataset.from_dataframe(df, privacy=DisclosurePrivacy())
```

# Conclusion
Synthetic data is a valuable tool for communicating about sensitive datasets. In this work, we have presented the software `metasynth`, which allows data owners to generate a synthetic version of their sensitive tabular data with a focus on privacy and transparency. Unlike existing tools for generating synthetic data, we choose to aim for low analytic validity to enable high privacy guarantees: the underlying model makes a simplifying independence assumption, resulting in few parameters and thus a very small information transfer. This approach additionally allows for disclosure guarantees through a plug-in system.
